        I am currently in high school and enrolled in Fordham Preparatory School. Fordham Prep offers one of the most rigorous curriculums of a high school that you can find in NYC.
        With over 20 APs, countless honors, advanced honors, and dual enrollment courses, students feel challenged and understand the importance of taking high-level classes.
        So far, I have completed two years of my high school experience, and I look forward to my next two years. Both years, I have been challenged in one way or another.
        Here are the courses I took both my Freshman and Sophomore years, and the courses I will be taking this upcoming academic year.
