    <div id="about_me">
        <p>Hello, I am Obiako Nwakile and this website is all about me and my achievements. I am currently
        a 15 year old rising junior in high school. My parents were born in Nigeria, and I was
        born here in the Bronx. I have 5 siblings: 4 sisters and 1 brother. My two favorite hobbies are working out and playing video
        games. As of right now, I am managing two jobs: All Star Code and SYEP. Everyday, I am challenged to push myself to excel in these two programs, and to think deeper. I feel that I am growing daily and I am gaining new personal and professional skills. I hope to continue developing new skills to better prepare myself for the future.
        My interests are in Computer Science, and I will like to have a job in coding. Click on the links on top of the website to find out more about me.</p>
